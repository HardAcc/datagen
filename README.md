DataGen
==========================

A collection of random data generation functions (Matlab and C++).
Used for generate long sequence of random data to test my sorters.

Reasoning:
The random generation function in current C++/Verilog tools failed to generate data wide and fast enough.

Available distributions:
* uniform
* negative exponential
* poisson
* self-similar
* Zipf
